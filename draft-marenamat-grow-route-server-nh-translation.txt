                   Route Server Next Hop Translation
        draft-marenamat-grow-route-server-nh-translation-latest

Abstract

   With the advent of RFC8950, Internet Exchang Points (IXPs) are
   enabled to rely solely on IPv6 addresses for adressing in their
   peering LANs.  However, routers not supporting RFC8950 are a
   technical roadblock.

   It is easier to extend the capabilities of the IXP Route Server (RS)
   instead of those of every unsupporting router.  Thus, this document
   introduces the concept of Specific Local Address Tables (SLATs).
   SLATs translate BGP next hops between all IXP members, regardless of
   their RFC8950 support, paving the way for IPv6-only IXPs.

1.  Introduction

   Traditionally, Internet Exchange Point (IXP) Border Gateway Protocol
   (BGP) Route Servers (RS) [RFC7947] serve IPv6 Network Layer
   Reachability Information (NRLI) with IPv6 next hops, and IPv4 NLRI
   with IPv4 next hops to the BGP speakers in their peering LAN.  On the
   one hand, this dual-stack operation allows both IPv4 and IPv6
   supporting BGP speakers to exchange NLRI with another and the route
   server.  On the other hand, this requires them to have next hop
   addresses of the same Address Familiy (AF) as well.

   With the depletion of available IPv4 address space, solutions have
   emerged to support forwarding of IPv4 traffic over IPv6-only
   intermediate hosts [I-D.chroboczek-intarea-v4-via-v6].  In the IXP
   environment, however, these networks would still require an IPv4
   address to be assigned to allow for routing from and to legacy-only
   networks where IPv6 next hops for IPv4 NLRIs [RFC8950] are not
   supported.

   This document specifies how to extend the Address Resolution Protocol
   (ARP) Proxy [RFC9161] functionality to allow deployment of IPv6 next
   hops for IPv4 NLRIs [RFC8950], without the need to assign public IPv4
   addresses to any of the BGP speakers at IXPs.

   This document does not cover IPv6 NLRIs with IPv4 next hops.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The terminology of [RFC9161], [RFC7947] and [RFC4271] applies.

   Client:  A BGP speaker which is connected to the IXP's Route Server.
      The Client may be a Legacy speaker, Supporting speaker or
      Unnumbered speaker.

   Legacy speaker:  Any Client with no support for IPv4 NLRIs with IPv6
      next hops in context of an IXP.

   Supporting speaker:  Any Client with support for IPv4 NLRIs with IPv6
      next hops, while still capable of producing and receiving IPv4
      next hops.

   Unnumbered speaker:  Any Client with support for IPv4 NLRIs with IPv6
      next hops, and with no support for IPv4 next hops.

   Production IPv4 prefix:  The IPv4 prefix used by the IXP operator to
      assign IPv4 addresses to the Clients.

   Production IPv6 prefix:  The IPv6 prefix used by the IXP operator to
      assign IPv6 addresses to the Clients.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Providing reachability between Legacy and Unnumbered speakers

   All IPv4 routes announced to and from Legacy speakers MUST have IPv4
   next hops, while all IPv4 routes announced to and from Unnumbered
   speakers MUST have IPv6 next hops.  To facilitate reachability
   between these Clients, we need to translate between IPv4 and IPv6
   next hops in BGP, IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) and ARP.

3.1.  Client Address Assignment

3.1.1.  MAC Address Assignment

   All Clients SHOULD have a fixed MAC address set and registered with
   the IXP.

3.1.2.  IPv6 Address Assignment

   All Clients MUST have their IPv6 link-local address (LLA) and IPv6
   globally unicast address (GUA) assigned by the IXP.  They MAY set
   these addresses up on the respective interfaces while their already
   established BGP sessions are still able to run.

   These assignments MUST be unique, such that for any two triples (MAC,
   LLA, GUA) and (MAC', LLA', GUA') it holds that MAC != MAC', LLA !=
   LLA' and GUA != GUA'.

   IPv6 addresses from the Production IPv6 prefix of the IXP MAY be used
   for GUA allocation if there are unused addresses available and the
   above requirement holds.

   The resulting set of triples is stored in a Local Address
   Table (LAT).  This table is maintained by the IXP and used to
   translate next hops to MAC addresses for Unnumbered speakers.

    +===================+====================+========================+
    | MAC Address       | Link Local Address | Global Unicast Address |
    +===================+====================+========================+
    | 00-00-5E-00-53-10 | FE80::10           | 2001:db8::10           |
    +-------------------+--------------------+------------------------+
    | 00-00-5E-00-53-20 | FE80::20           | 2001:db8::20           |
    +-------------------+--------------------+------------------------+
    | ...               | ...                | ...                    |
    +-------------------+--------------------+------------------------+

                     Table 1: Local Address Table (LAT)

3.1.3.  IPv4 Address Assignment

   Due to IPv4 scarcity, IXP are typically assigned much less spacious
   Production IPv4 prefixes than Production IPv6 prefixes.  Therefore,
   the IXP, in cooperation with every Supporting Speaker and Legacy
   Speaker, MUST decide on an IPv4 prefix (or a set of IPv4 prefixes)
   short enough to accommodate the number of Clients in the IXP network.
   This prefix MAY be different for different Clients.  This prefix is
   called Client-specific local prefix (CSLP).

   For every Supporting and Legacy Speaker, the IXP then adds another
   column for every CSLP to the LAT, completing it to a Specific Local
   Address Table (SLAT).  These columns then hold a unique IPv4 address
   assigned from the respective CSLP for every triple in the LAT.  These
   entries are used to translate next hops to MAC addresses for Legacy
   speakers.

   +===================+========+============+=========+==========+===+
   | MAC Address       |Link    |Global      |CSLP 1   |CLSP 2    |...|
   |                   |Local   |Unicast     |         |          |   |
   |                   |Address |Address     |         |          |   |
   +===================+========+============+=========+==========+===+
   | MAC Address       |Link    |Global      |CSLP 1   |CLSP 2    |...|
   |                   |Local   |Unicast     |         |          |   |
   |                   |Address |Address     |         |          |   |
   +-------------------+--------+------------+---------+----------+---+
   | 00-00-5E-00-53-10 |FE80::10|2001:db8::10|10.0.0.10|192.0.2.10|...|
   +-------------------+--------+------------+---------+----------+---+
   | 00-00-5E-00-53-20 |FE80::20|2001:db8::20|10.0.0.20|192.0.2.20|...|
   +-------------------+--------+------------+---------+----------+---+
   | ...               |...     |...         |...      |...       |...|
   +-------------------+--------+------------+---------+----------+---+

               Table 2: Specific Local Address Table (SLAT)

   The Unnumbered Speakers need no such prefix negotiation and therefore
   have no risk of adding another CSLP to bloat the SLAT.

   Legacy Speakers SHOULD set up their NEXT_HOP attribute handling so
   that they never propagate the IPv4 addresses from the SLAT outside
   any communication with the RS.

3.2.  ARP and ND Proxy Configuration

   For each Client, the IXP MUST set up ARP and ND snooping.  The IXP
   MUST NOT forward neither ARP nor ND traffic between Clients.  The IXP
   MUST answer all ARP and ND requests from the Clients themselves using
   the respective SLAT column for that Client.

3.3.  NEXT_HOP Attribute Management at Route Servers

   When a route with IPv4 NLRI and IPv4 NEXT_HOP Attribute is announced
   from any Client, the RS MUST rewrite the NEXT_HOP according to the
   Client's IPv6 GUA or LLA entry in the SLAT.

   When the RS sends a route to a Legacy speaker, it MUST rewrite the
   NEXT_HOP according to the IPv4 address assigned for the sender in the
   receiver's CSLP column of the SLAT.

   When the Route Server sends a route to a Supporting speaker, it
   SHOULD NOT rewrite the NEXT_HOP.

   When the Route server sends a route to an Unnumbered speaker, it MUST
   NOT rewrite the NEXT_HOP.

   The Route Server MUST NOT propagate any route where the NEXT_HOP
   attribute holds an address not assigned to any Clients in the SLAT.

   Section 2.2.1 of [RFC7947] does not apply.

4.  IXP Interconnection Space

   This document requests an allocation of an IPv4 IXP Interconnection
   Space from the experimental range.  By previous efforts
   [I-D.schoen-intarea-unicast-240], it has already been shown that
   these addresses are technically feasible to be used in limited
   environments.  Here, the use is limited for local next hop resolution
   and possibly BGP session addressing.

   It is RECOMMENDED that this prefix is used as the CLSP for every
   Client that does not use this prefix for other purposes.  Having the
   same prefix as the IXP Interconnection Space for many Clients helps
   to reduce the size of the SLAT.

   Clients MUST NOT propagate any routes with IPv4 NLRI from the IXP
   Interconnection Space.

   Section 2.2.2 of [RFC6890] is updated by adding the following record:

           +======================+===========================+
           | Attribute            | Value                     |
           +======================+===========================+
           | Address Block        | TBD                       |
           +----------------------+---------------------------+
           | Name                 | IXP Interconnection Space |
           +----------------------+---------------------------+
           | RFC                  | TBD                       |
           +----------------------+---------------------------+
           | Allocation Date      | TBD                       |
           +----------------------+---------------------------+
           | Termination Date     | N/A                       |
           +----------------------+---------------------------+
           | Source               | False                     |
           +----------------------+---------------------------+
           | Destination          | False                     |
           +----------------------+---------------------------+
           | Forwardable          | False                     |
           +----------------------+---------------------------+
           | Global               | False                     |
           +----------------------+---------------------------+
           | Reserved-by-Protocol | False                     |
           +----------------------+---------------------------+

                      Table 3: Shared Address Space

   The allocation is probably not strictly needed, as most of the Legacy
   Speakers will still have some of the private IPv4 addresses [RFC1918]
   available to use for the SLAT.  Yet, these available ranges may be
   different between networks.  To reduce complexity, this allocation
   will help IXPs to have a shared SLAT for most of the Legacy Speakers.

   Some large networks have also claimed recently Section 6.1 of
   [I-D.schoen-intarea-unicast-240] that they are already using the
   experimental range for their internal purposes because they are
   already out of the private IPv4 addresses.  These networks would have
   probably needed to negotiate a custom CLSP with the IXP anyway, with
   or without the allocation.

5.  Operational and Management Considerations

5.1.  Step-by-Step Rollout

   This setup should be possible to be rolled out in steps.  First, the
   ARP and ND snooping is not dependent on anything else in this
   document.  Then, setting up a new route server supporting IPv6 next
   hops for IPv4 NLRI, and allowing Supporting speakers to use that
   server while keeping also the traditional one.

   The SLAT may be started as uniform for every Client reflecting the
   current address assignment from the Production IPv4 prefix.  This
   allows the Legacy Speakers into the new route server, and gradual
   renumbering may occur later, Client-by-Client, when the Production
   IPv4 prefix starts being exhausted.

   The Clients have to properly assess which address range is suitable
   for them to use for IXP interconnection.  If using the IXP
   Interconnection Space, they also have to check whether these
   addresses are considered eligible as next hops by their routing
   equipment.

5.2.  Bilateral Peerings

   There might be reasons why any two Clients do not want to use the
   IXP's RS to exchange their routing information.  Hence, the
   information from the SLAT should be made publicly available and kept
   up to date.  Clients can then perform the next hop translation
   themselves.

   An alternative is to introduce a new BGP community that tells the RS
   to exclude the routing information exchanged via such bilateral
   peerings from the Looking Glasses (LG).  This can be useful if
   privacy is of a concern and no self-translation can be performed.

5.3.  Address Translation Transparency

   The IXPs may have to rethink how they are displaying the route next
   hops in their human-facing interfaces (Looking Glasses).  It may be
   handy to display the original next hop (if it was IPv4), the actual
   IPv6 next hop, and also the result of the egress translation for a
   selected Client.

6.  Security Considerations

   Implementing the ARP and ND snooping should improve the overall
   security of IXPs by blocking possible ARP or ND spoofing, both
   inadvertent and intended [DE-CIX-EVPN].

   Mistakes in the MAC address registration and manual management of IP
   address assignment may lead to inadvertent invalid route
   announcement.  It's recommended to run automated address management
   with a single source of truth.

   Mistakes in the next hop address translation may lead to inadvertent
   invalid route announcement.  It's recommended to run periodic
   automated checks whether the next hops actually resolve to the same
   address by the appropriate SLAT.

   Mistakes in route announcements are contained to the route not being
   propagated further.

   Mistakes in the Client setup may lead to spreading unreachable routes
   across their autonomous systems, causing inefficient routing.

   It is recommended to log rogue GARP or IPv6 DAD communication to
   detect possible misconfigurations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to record the allocation of an IPv4 /8 from the 240/4
   range for use as IXP Interconnection Space as requested in Section 4.

   The IXP Interconnection Space address range is: x.0.0.0/8.

   _[Note to RFC Editor: this address range to be added before
   publication]_
