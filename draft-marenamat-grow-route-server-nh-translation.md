--- abstract

With the advent of RFC8950, Internet Exchang Points (IXPs) are enabled to rely
solely on IPv6 addresses for adressing in their peering LANs. However, routers
not supporting RFC8950 are a technical roadblock.

It is easier to extend the capabilities of the IXP Route Server (RS) instead
of those of every unsupporting router. Thus, this document introduces the concept of Specific
Local Address Tables (SLATs). SLATs translate BGP next hops between all IXP members,
regardless of their RFC8950 support, paving the way for IPv6-only IXPs.

# Introduction

Traditionally, Internet Exchange Point (IXP) Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
Route Servers (RS) {{-internet-exchange}} serve IPv6 Network Layer Reachability
Information (NRLI) with IPv6 next hops, and IPv4 NLRI with IPv4 next hops to the
BGP speakers in their peering LAN.
On the one hand, this dual-stack operation allows both IPv4 and IPv6 supporting BGP
speakers to exchange NLRI with another and the route server. On
the other hand, this requires them to have next hop addresses of the same Address
Familiy (AF) as well.

With the depletion of available IPv4 address space, solutions have emerged to
support forwarding of IPv4 traffic over IPv6-only intermediate hosts {{-mixed-nh}}.
In the IXP environment, however, these networks would still require an IPv4 address
to be assigned to allow for routing from and to legacy-only networks where IPv6 next hops
for IPv4 NLRIs {{-bgp-mixed-nh}} are not supported.

This document specifies how to extend the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Proxy
{{-peering-evpn-arp-proxy}} functionality to allow deployment of IPv6 next hops for
IPv4 NLRIs {{-bgp-mixed-nh}}, without the need to assign public IPv4 addresses to
any of the BGP speakers at IXPs.

This document does not cover IPv6 NLRIs with IPv4 next hops.

# Conventions and Definitions

The terminology of {{-peering-evpn-arp-proxy}}, {{-internet-exchange}}
and {{-bgp}} applies.

Client:
: A BGP speaker which is connected to the IXP's Route Server. The Client
  may be a Legacy speaker, Supporting speaker or Unnumbered speaker.

Legacy speaker:
: Any Client with no support for IPv4 NLRIs with IPv6 next hops
  in context of an IXP.

Supporting speaker:
: Any Client with support for IPv4 NLRIs with IPv6 next hops,
  while still capable of producing and receiving IPv4 next hops.

Unnumbered speaker:
: Any Client with support for IPv4 NLRIs with IPv6 next hops,
  and with no support for IPv4 next hops.

Production IPv4 prefix:
: The IPv4 prefix used by the IXP operator to assign IPv4 addresses
to the Clients.

Production IPv6 prefix:
: The IPv6 prefix used by the IXP operator to assign IPv6 addresses
to the Clients.

# Providing reachability between Legacy and Unnumbered speakers

All IPv4 routes announced to and from Legacy speakers MUST have IPv4 next hops,
while all IPv4 routes announced to and from Unnumbered speakers MUST have IPv6
next hops. To facilitate reachability between these Clients, we need to
translate between IPv4 and IPv6 next hops in BGP, IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
and ARP.

## Client Address Assignment

### MAC Address Assignment

All Clients SHOULD have a fixed MAC address set and registered
with the IXP.

### IPv6 Address Assignment

All Clients MUST have their IPv6 link-local address (LLA)
and IPv6 globally unicast address (GUA) assigned by the IXP.
They MAY set these addresses up on the respective interfaces
while their already established BGP sessions are still able to run.

These assignments MUST be unique, such that for any two triples
`(MAC, LLA, GUA)` and `(MAC', LLA', GUA')` it holds that
`MAC != MAC'`, `LLA != LLA'` and `GUA != GUA'`.

IPv6 addresses from the Production IPv6 prefix of the IXP MAY be
used for GUA allocation if there are unused addresses available
and the above requirement holds.

The resulting set of triples is stored in a Local Address Table (LAT).
This table is maintained by the IXP and used to translate next hops
to MAC addresses for Unnumbered speakers.

| MAC Address | Link Local Address | Global Unicast Address |
| 00-00-5E-00-53-10 | FE80::10 | 2001:db8::10 |
| 00-00-5E-00-53-20 | FE80::20 | 2001:db8::20 |
| ... | ... | ... |
{: title="Local Address Table (LAT)"}

### IPv4 Address Assignment

Due to IPv4 scarcity, IXP are typically assigned much less spacious
Production IPv4 prefixes than Production IPv6 prefixes. Therefore, the IXP,
in cooperation with every Supporting Speaker and Legacy Speaker, MUST decide
on an IPv4 prefix (or a set of IPv4 prefixes) short enough to accommodate
the number of Clients in the IXP network. This prefix MAY be different
for different Clients. This prefix is called Client-specific local prefix
(CSLP).

For every Supporting and Legacy Speaker, the IXP then adds another column for
every CSLP to the LAT, completing it to a Specific Local Address Table (SLAT).
These columns then hold a unique IPv4 address assigned from the respective CSLP
for every triple in the LAT. These entries are used to translate next hops
to MAC addresses for Legacy speakers.

| MAC Address | Link Local Address | Global Unicast Address | CSLP 1 | CLSP 2 | ...
| MAC Address | Link Local Address | Global Unicast Address | CSLP 1 | CLSP 2 | ...
| 00-00-5E-00-53-10 | FE80::10 | 2001:db8::10 | 10.0.0.10 | 192.0.2.10 | ...
| 00-00-5E-00-53-20 | FE80::20 | 2001:db8::20 | 10.0.0.20 | 192.0.2.20 | ...
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
{: title="Specific Local Address Table (SLAT)"}

The Unnumbered Speakers need no such prefix negotiation and therefore have
no risk of adding another CSLP to bloat the SLAT.

Legacy Speakers SHOULD set up their NEXT_HOP attribute handling so that they
never propagate the IPv4 addresses from the SLAT outside any communication
with the RS.

## ARP and ND Proxy Configuration

For each Client, the IXP MUST set up ARP and ND snooping. The IXP MUST NOT
forward neither ARP nor ND traffic between Clients. The IXP MUST answer
all ARP and ND requests from the Clients themselves using the respective SLAT
column for that Client.

## NEXT_HOP Attribute Management at Route Servers

When a route with IPv4 NLRI and IPv4 NEXT_HOP Attribute is announced from any
Client, the RS MUST rewrite the NEXT_HOP according to the Client's
IPv6 GUA or LLA entry in the SLAT.

When the RS sends a route to a Legacy speaker, it MUST rewrite
the NEXT_HOP according to the IPv4 address assigned for the sender in the
receiver's CSLP column of the SLAT.

When the Route Server sends a route to a Supporting speaker, it SHOULD NOT
rewrite the NEXT_HOP.

When the Route server sends a route to an Unnumbered speaker,
it MUST NOT rewrite the NEXT_HOP.

The Route Server MUST NOT propagate any route where the NEXT_HOP attribute
holds an address not assigned to any Clients in the SLAT.

{{Section 2.2.1 of -internet-exchange}} does not apply.

# IXP Interconnection Space {#ixp-interconnection-space}

This document requests an allocation of an IPv4 IXP Interconnection Space
from the experimental range. By previous efforts {{-schoen-240}}, it has already
been shown that these addresses are technically feasible to be used in limited
environments. Here, the use is limited for local next hop resolution and possibly
BGP session addressing.

It is RECOMMENDED that this prefix is used as the CLSP for every Client that does
not use this prefix for other purposes. Having the same prefix as the IXP
Interconnection Space for many Clients helps to reduce the size of the SLAT.

Clients MUST NOT propagate any routes with IPv4 NLRI from the
IXP Interconnection Space.

{{Section 2.2.2 of -special-purpose-ip}} is updated by adding the following
record:

| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Attribute            | Value                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Address Block        | TBD                       |
| Name                 | IXP Interconnection Space |
| RFC                  | TBD                       |
| Allocation Date      | TBD                       |
| Termination Date     | N/A                       |
| Source               | False                     |
| Destination          | False                     |
| Forwardable          | False                     |
| Global               | False                     |
| Reserved-by-Protocol | False                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
{: title="Shared Address Space"}

The allocation is probably not strictly needed, as most of the Legacy Speakers
will still have some of the private IPv4 addresses {{-private-ipv4}} available
to use for the SLAT.  Yet, these available ranges may be different between
networks. To reduce complexity, this allocation will help IXPs to have a shared
SLAT for most of the Legacy Speakers.

Some large networks have also claimed recently {{Section 6.1 of -schoen-240}}
that they are already using the experimental range for their internal purposes
because they are already out of the private IPv4 addresses. These networks would
have probably needed to negotiate a custom CLSP with the IXP anyway, with
or without the allocation.

# Operational and Management Considerations

## Step-by-Step Rollout

This setup should be possible to be rolled out in steps. First, the ARP and ND
snooping is not dependent on anything else in this document. Then, setting up
a new route server supporting IPv6 next hops for IPv4 NLRI, and allowing Supporting
speakers to use that server while keeping also the traditional one.

The SLAT may be started as uniform for every Client reflecting the current address
assignment from the Production IPv4 prefix. This allows the Legacy Speakers into
the new route server, and gradual renumbering may occur later, Client-by-Client,
when the Production IPv4 prefix starts being exhausted.

The Clients have to properly assess which address range is suitable for them to use
for IXP interconnection. If using the IXP Interconnection Space, they also have to
check whether these addresses are considered eligible as next hops by their routing
equipment.

## Bilateral Peerings

There might be reasons why any two Clients do not want to use the IXP's RS to
exchange their routing information. Hence, the information from the SLAT
should be made publicly available and kept up to date. Clients can then perform
the next hop translation themselves.

An alternative is to introduce a new BGP community that tells the RS to exclude
the routing information exchanged via such bilateral peerings from the Looking
Glasses (LG). This can be useful if privacy is of a concern and no self-translation
can be performed.

## Address Translation Transparency

The IXPs may have to rethink how they are displaying the route next hops in
their human-facing interfaces (Looking Glasses). It may be handy to display
the original next hop (if it was IPv4), the actual IPv6 next hop, and also
the result of the egress translation for a selected Client.

# Security Considerations

Implementing the ARP and ND snooping should improve the overall security of IXPs
by blocking possible ARP or ND spoofing, both inadvertent and intended {{DE-CIX-EVPN}}.

Mistakes in the MAC address registration and manual management of IP address assignment
may lead to inadvertent invalid route announcement. It's recommended to run automated
address management with a single source of truth.

Mistakes in the next hop address translation may lead to inadvertent invalid
route announcement. It's recommended to run periodic automated checks whether
the next hops actually resolve to the same address by the appropriate SLAT.

Mistakes in route announcements are contained to the route not being propagated further.

Mistakes in the Client setup may lead to spreading unreachable routes across
their autonomous systems, causing inefficient routing.

It is recommended to log rogue GARP or IPv6 DAD communication to detect
possible misconfigurations.

# IANA Considerations

IANA is asked to record the allocation of an IPv4 /8 from the 240/4 range
for use as IXP Interconnection Space as requested in {{ixp-interconnection-space}}.

The IXP Interconnection Space address range is: x.0.0.0/8.
